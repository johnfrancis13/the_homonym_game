## About
The Homonym Game is a social-linguistic game based around the etymologies of [homonyms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homonym). For the purpose of this game, homonyms are words that have multiple defintions. But why might the spelling of a word have two or more definitons you ask? That is up for YOU, the players, to convince your friends (or simply the 'other players') of. In the tradition of games like Apples to Apples or Cards Against Humanity, players take turns judging the quality, hilarity, sophistication, and cleverness of the other players answers. The most hilarious, clever, and sophisticated player at the end of the game (as determined by points) wins! 

#### Homonym Example
For example, the word 'bow' has many defintions and can mean:
<br>
<br>1. a long stick with horse hair that is used to play certain string instruments such as the violin
<br>2. to bend forward at the waist in respect (e.g. "bow down")
<br>3. the front of the ship (e.g. "bow and stern")
<br>4. a kind of tied ribbon (e.g. bow on a present, a bowtie)
<br>5. to bend outward at the sides (e.g. a "bow-legged" cowboy)
<br>6. a weapon to shoot projectiles with (e.g. a bow and arrow)

### Playing the The Homonym Game
The game is best played with at least three people, and the rules are simple.

* A game consists of N rounds which can either be predetermined at the beginning of the game, or played for a set amount of time.
* A round consists of one turn per the number of players, with each player in turn taking on the role of Judge.
* On their turn as the Judge, the Judge must select a homonym (using the generate a homonym button), and then determine which defintions (all or a subset) they would like to include for the turn.
* The remaining players then have up to one minute to come up with an etymological explanation for why all the defintions are connected to the chosen homonym. Players may make up facts and do whatever they must to reach their explanation. Going clockwise (or through a blind written submission), the players present their etymological explanations to the Judge.
* The Judge then awards 1 point to whomeever has the funninest/cleverest/most interesting explanation, ties are allowed, and then the turn ends, moving the role of Judge onto the next player.
* At the end of the game the player with the most points wins!
